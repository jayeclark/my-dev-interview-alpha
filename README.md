My Dev Interview serves random video interview questions (and a few curveballs!) and lets you save and review your top responses. It's great for:
- Planning answers to behavioral or technical interview questions
- Practicing those answers on camera (with and without notes)
- Reviewing your videos to check on progress and make notes for future improvements
- Sharing videos with friends and mentors to get valuable feedback on how to improve
